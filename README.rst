Django Autocomplete
===================

Autocomplete for django models. Form widgets and admin integration examples.

Requirements
------------

-  Django ``>=1.7.x``.
-  Python ``3``

Installation
------------

Simple install into a virtualenv::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/darrylcousins/django-autocomplete.git

Build and Run Test Project
--------------------------

Get the test project from github::

    $ git clone https://github.com/darrylcousins/django-project.git
    $ cd django-project

The test project uses django-bootstrap3_ and bootstrapped3_ admin.  these extra
packages can be installed with::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

The test project has some tests::

    $ python manage.py test project

The tables and sample data can be installed with::

    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py loaddata project/fixtures/project.json

And can be run with::

    $ python manage.py runserver 9000

There are no urls beyond the admin screens and api json views. It attempts to
demonstrate the autocomplete widgets. All models demonstrate some aspect of the widgets.

Setting up models to use autocomplete
-------------------------------------

To set up models to use the autocomplete widgets they need to have a api view
that will return json which is a list of the items filtered by the request
variable `term`, which itself is the default search variable sent with request
by the `jqueryui autocomplete widget <http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/>`_.

The design decision of this package is to have configuration made at the model level::

    >>> class MyModel(models.Model):
    ...     autocomplete = AutocompleteMeta(
    ...       name=name,
    ...       path='api/filter/mymodel'

The meta model has other attributes that may be set.

Permissions may be set for the autocomplete in three ways. As a boolean, if
true then the request user must be authenticated, if a string then the single
permission is checked, if a list then the user must have all permissions in the
list (see `has_perms
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_perm>`_).

The default is ``None``::

    ...      permissions=True,
    ...      permissions='is_staff',
    ...      permissions=['is_staff'],

The default is to filter on all Char and Text fields but the developer can
define the fields to search on::

    ...      fields=['name', 'description'],

The default behaviour is to also search on searchable fields in the models
related by ForeignKey, but this can be disabled::

    ...      follow_fks=False,
    ...     )


.. note:: setting an attribute `autocomplete` that is an instance of
          `:class:django_autocomplete.meta.Autocomplete` is required for each model
          chosen to use autocomplete widgets.

Urls
----

As can be seen above, each model sets its path to the api view. In order for
these views to be created set the following in `urls.py`::

        url(r'', include('django_autocomplete.urls')),

.. note:: do not use a prefix (e.g. r'api/') as only the path set by
          `MyModel.autocomplete.path` is used.

Once this is done then the view (following the `MyModel` example)
`/api/filter/mymodel/` will be available to the autocomplete widgets::

        http://localhost:8000/api/filter/mymodel/?term=se

The View
--------

The view used to answer the get request is
:class`django_autocomplete.views.AutocompleteView`. This view has its own
``search`` method but the developer can provide a custom search method for the
autocomplete. From the :class`AutocompleteView`::

        // the developer can implement own search method
        if hasattr(self.model.objects, 'search'):
            queryset = self.model.objects.search(
                self.model.objects.all(),
                self.request,
                [term])
        else:
            queryset = self.search(
                self.model.objects.all(),
                [term])

Admin
-----

Formfield widgets
*****************

The only examples found in the example project hooks the widgets into the
bootstrapped3_
admin. To use the widgets all that is required in most cases is to set
`formfield_overrides`::

        class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
            formfield_overrides = {
              models.ForeignKey: {'widget': AutocompleteSelectWidget},
              models.ManyToManyField: {'widget': AutocompleteSelectMultipleWidget},
              }

Equally so for inlines formsets::

        class MyModelInline(admin.TabularInline):
            formfield_overrides = {
              models.ForeignKey: {'widget': AutocompleteSelectWidget},
              models.ManyToManyField: {'widget': AutocompleteSelectMultipleWidget},
              }

`AutocompleteSelectMultipleWidget` can also be used in reverse many to one
relationships but an admin form will be required. See
`class:project.forms.CountryModelForm` for an example.

.. note:: For inlines the template `admin/inlines/inline_tabular.html` has been
          altered to hook the widgets into the javascript.

Generic Content Type Widget
***************************

There is a autocomplete widget for generic content types. Simplest implementation is as above::

        class TaggedItemAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
            model = TaggedItem
            formfield_overrides = {
                models.ForeignKey: {'widget': AutocompleteCTWidget},
                }

But some assumptions are made, namely the ``object_id`` is assumed to be name
``object_id``. More finely grained implementation will use ``formfield_for_foreignkey``::

        def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
            if db_field.rel.to == ContentType:
                kwargs['widget'] = AutocompleteCTWidget
                kwargs['widget'].object_field = 'object_id'
            return super(TaggedItemAdmin, self).formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)

Although untested it should allow for a different name for the ``object_id`` field and for models with more than one ``GenericForeignKey``.

It has not been tested for inline forms but there is an example of usage in `django-project`_.

Changelist Search
*****************

`class:django_autocomplete.widgets.SearchInput` can be used in the
bootstrapped3_ admin list views to provide autocomplete search for autocomplete
enabled models.

This must be explicitly configured in the ModelAdmin::

        class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
            model = MyModel
            search_form = searchform_factory(MyModel)

..note:: The template `admin/search_form.html` tests for the presence
         `model_admin.search_form` and renders the form if defined.

Using Widgets Outside the Admin
-------------------------------

Each of the widgets need to be aware of the model they are searching. Thus they
have access to the `autocomplete` attribute of the model. The example form
`:model:django_autocomplete.forms.SearchForm` provides and example of setting
up a form to be model aware. It closely follows the django ModelForm to do so.
